## Introduction ðŸ‘‘
Here are some small toys following the [Official ThreeJS Documents](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and the [Troisjs Guidlines](https://troisjs.github.io/), a framework designed for vue. 

### Dependencies
1. `vue-cli` for quick project construction
2. `element-plus` for layout and small tools
3. `three`, `troisjs` for rendering based on webGL

### How to run
```bash
cd three-js-tutorials
npm install   # install all dependencies
npm run serve # start serve
```
It takes a few seconds for models to be loaded, please be patient :)

##### Problems
I managed to create basic geometries and render them, and load models with textures and animations using `three.js`. But I failed to load any local resource in `troisjs` after a thousand trials. Could you tell me why?  

welcome for communication ðŸ˜‰
